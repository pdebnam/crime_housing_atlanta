# Crime and Housing Prices in Atlanta
Group project completed for *Machine Learning* course at Georgia Tech during the Spring '21 semester. Used Python and scikit-learn to develop models which identified positive correlations between crime rates and housing prices, as well as predicted home prices with an optimal RMSE score. All code and pertinent files are sgored on my classmate's personal Github portal. A link to the project description and findings (hosted on Github Pages) is below.
